1. Why did you choose that particular framework?

I chose React because it is a very popular framework. Since it is very popular, I think it is a great idea for me to have some experience in using it. 
Additionally, I chose this framework because it sounded cool to me. Also, I should mention that it is one of the top choices for devlopers right now.

2. What difficulties you ran into and, if you were able, how you overcame them.

The main issue that I ran into was initially installing npm and node. THe video that was prescribed by the tutorial on Scrimba, it led me down a road that took over an hour to fix.
Whenever I tried to install the latest version, it would get lost somewhere and I could not install npm. I ended up looking at other videos and this video helped me solve that issue.
